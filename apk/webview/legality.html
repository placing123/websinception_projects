                    <p>megastar11 takes great care to comply with all central and state legislation in India to ensure that our users are fully protected. Every contest on our platform is carefully
designed to comply with applicable statutes and regulations in India.</p>
                    <p>Below are the key points from an Indian High Court’s judgment specifically regarding
megastar11's game format and fantasy games. A challenge to this judgment was also
dismissed by the Supreme Court of India:</p>
                    <ul class="list-unstyled">
                      <li>The Court, in its ruling, stated that playing the megastar11 game involves
considerable skill, judgment and discretion and that success on megastar11 arises
out of users’ exercise, superior knowledge, judgment and attention</li>
                      <li>The Court also held that ‘the element of skill’ had a predominant influence on the
outcome of the megastar11 game, which follows the following format:
                        <ul class="strong_text list-unstyled my-3" style="font-weight: bold;">
                          <li>Participants have to choose a team consisting of at least the same no. of players as playing in a real-life sports team (e.g. 5 in basketball, 7 in kabaddi and 11 in cricket/football)</li>
                          <li>All contests are run for at least the duration of one full sports match</li>
                          <li>No team changes are allowed by participants after the start of the sports match</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>On this basis, the Court adjudged that playing on megastar11 constitutes a ‘game of mere skill’, which makes the megastar11 game exempt from the provisions of the Public Gambling Act, 1867 (PGA).</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>Finally, the Court held that the fantasy games are a legitimate business activity protected under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can find more information on the legality of Fantasy Sports in India on the website of the Indian Federation of Sports Gaming (IFSG): <a href="http://www.ifsg.in/" target="_blank">www.ifsg.in</a>. IFSG is India’s first and only self-
